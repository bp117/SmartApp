And our 'Global Fellows Volunteering Program' brings together passionate individuals from around the world to contribute to these transformative projects."

**Slide 12: Deployment Options: Low Cost vs. No Cost**
"In considering deployment, we presented two strategic options. The low-cost option involves deploying the handbook on platforms like Netlify or Vercel, and utilizing Google Cloud for the chatbot. This offers robustness and scalability. On the other hand, the no-cost option leverages your existing Wix CMS platform, integrating seamlessly with Mantra’s digital infrastructure, and employs Botpress Chat Builder for the chatbot, ensuring cost-effectiveness without compromising on functionality."

**Slide 13: Conclusion**
"In conclusion, this project is more than a technological advancement; it's a stepping stone towards greater efficiency and empowerment in all our endeavors, from Banking Without Borders to Mantra4Change, and the Global Fellows Volunteering Program.
