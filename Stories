Creating agile stories for a project involving use case onboarding, AI model onboarding, new document collection, and document management involves breaking down each of these features into smaller, manageable tasks. Each story should have clear acceptance criteria to ensure that it meets the required functionality. Here's how you can structure these stories:

### 1. Use Case Onboarding
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As a user, I want to onboard new use cases through an intuitive UI so that I can easily expand the system's capabilities.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - UI allows for input of use case details (name, description, objectives).
  - Validation for input fields to ensure data quality.
  - Success message or confirmation upon successful submission.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to process new use case data from the frontend and store it efficiently.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoint to receive and validate new use case data.
  - Integration with a database to store use case information.
  - Proper error handling and response to the frontend in case of failure.

### 2. AI Model Onboarding
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As a user, I want to onboard new AI models to enhance the system’s analytical capabilities.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - UI to upload AI model files and specify model parameters.
  - Progress bar or indicator during model upload.
  - Confirmation message upon successful model upload.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to handle the upload and integration of new AI models.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoint to receive, validate, and store AI model files.
  - Functionality to integrate uploaded models into the system.
  - Appropriate responses and error handling for the model upload process.

### 3. New Document Collection
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As a user, I want to add new document collections for analysis and management.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - UI for uploading and categorizing new documents.
  - Features for tagging and describing documents.
  - Notification upon successful document upload.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to manage the storage and categorization of newly uploaded documents.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for document upload and metadata processing.
  - Integration with a document management system or database.
  - Error handling and feedback for document upload processes.

### 4. Document Management
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As a user, I want to manage documents within the system, including editing, deleting, and viewing.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Interface for searching, viewing, and editing document details.
  - Options to delete documents with confirmation prompts.
  - Real-time updates and feedback on document operations.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to facilitate document management operations like editing and deletion.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for document retrieval, update, and deletion.
  - Secure handling of document operations with proper authorization.
  - Efficient response and error handling for document management requests.

Each of these stories should be developed and tested separately for the frontend and backend to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.


Creating agile stories for User Management with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in admin screens involves defining tasks for creating, updating, managing, and deleting user roles and permissions. Here's how you can structure these stories:

### 1. User Creation and Management
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As an admin, I want to create and manage user accounts to control access to the system.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Interface to add new users with details like name, email, and role.
  - Options to edit existing user information.
  - Ability to deactivate or delete user accounts.
  - Validation and feedback on user creation or modification actions.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to handle user account creation, updates, and deletions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting user accounts.
  - Secure handling of user data and actions.
  - Proper authentication and error handling for user management requests.

### 2. Role Creation and Management
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As an admin, I want to define and manage different user roles to assign appropriate access levels.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - UI for creating new roles with specific permissions.
  - Ability to edit or delete existing roles.
  - Clear display of assigned permissions for each role.
  - Easy-to-use interface for modifying role permissions.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to support the creation, modification, and deletion of user roles and permissions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for role and permission management.
  - Secure storage and handling of role data.
  - Validation of role actions and appropriate feedback to the frontend.

### 3. Access Control and Permissions
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As an admin, I want to assign and manage permissions for different roles to control system access effectively.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Interface to assign permissions to roles.
  - Visual representation of permission levels for each role.
  - Options to modify or revoke permissions.
  - Confirmation prompts for critical permission changes.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to process and enforce permission assignments and modifications.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for assigning and modifying permissions.
  - Logic to enforce permissions based on user roles.
  - Secure and efficient handling of permission data.

### 4. User Role Assignment
#### Frontend (React)
- **Story**: As an admin, I want to assign roles to users to define their access and capabilities within the system.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - UI to select a user and assign them a specific role.
  - Display of current role for each user.
  - Ability to change or remove a user’s role.
  - Confirmation and feedback on role assignment changes.

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Story**: As a backend service, I need to handle the assignment and updating of user roles.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - API endpoints for role assignment to users.
  - Mechanism to update user roles and manage role changes.
  - Secure verification and validation of role assignments.

These stories ensure comprehensive coverage of user management aspects, including creation, role assignment, and access control, all crucial for maintaining system security and functionality.
