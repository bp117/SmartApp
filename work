here is my existing code for the chat interface, Now act as a super talented react developer and fix the below issues 1. Add scrollbar to the side bar when the list grows and goes beyound screen visible height 2. the appbar and the chat input should remain fixed and only the middle chat interface should scroll through the messages using the browser window scrollbar. add labels to the top right 3 components Lob label, select component 's label as collection and upload abel upload icon. Make the changes so that it is responsive across different screen sizes and browsers
ChatGPT
Alright, let's tackle the issues you mentioned step by step:

Add scrollbar to the sidebar: This will involve adding an overflow-y: auto; CSS style to the sidebar container. It will ensure that a scrollbar appears when the content exceeds the height of the container.

Fix the appbar and the chat input: This can be achieved by using the CSS property position: fixed; for the appbar and chat input. We also need to ensure that the middle chat interface scrolls without affecting these fixed components.

Add labels to the top right 3 components: This might involve creating a new component or adding text next to the existing components, depending on the current structure of your components.

Responsive Design: We'll ensure that the layout remains consistent and usable across different screen sizes using media queries and flexible layouts.

Let's start by checking the contents of each uploaded file to understand the current structure and then make the necessary modifications. I'll begin with AppBar.tsx.

Alright, let's take a look at the contents of AppBar.tsx to get a sense of the current structure.

Show work
The AppBar.tsx file seems to define a React component for the app bar using Material-UI.

For the tasks at hand, here's what needs to be done for AppBar.tsx:

Change the position attribute of MuiAppBar from "static" to "fixed".
Adjust the top margin/padding of the content below the app bar to avoid it being hidden behind the fixed app bar.
I'll go ahead and make this change to AppBar.tsx.

Finished working
Show work
I've updated the AppBar.tsx to make the app bar fixed at the top.

Next, let's check the content of Sidebar.tsx to add a scrollbar when the list grows beyond the screen height.

Finished working
Show work
The Sidebar.tsx file defines the sidebar component, which lists conversations and offers options to manipulate them.

To ensure the sidebar displays a scrollbar when its content exceeds the viewport height, we'll make the following changes:

Add overflow-y: auto; style to the main container (div) of the sidebar to enable vertical scrolling when content overflows.
We might also need to set a maximum height to ensure that the scrollbar appears correctly. We'll set it to max-height: calc(100vh - AppBarHeight);, where AppBarHeight would be the height of the app bar (assuming a height of 64px for the app bar, but you should adjust this value according to your design).
Let's go ahead and make these changes.

Finished working
Show work
I've updated the Sidebar.tsx to ensure that a scrollbar appears when the sidebar content exceeds the height of the viewport.

Next, let's check the content of ChatInterface.tsx to make sure:

Only the chat messages area is scrollable while keeping the app bar and chat input fixed.
The chat messages area is adjusted to avoid overlapping with the fixed app bar and chat input.
Let's take a look at ChatInterface.tsx.

Finished working
Show work
The ChatInterface.tsx seems to define the main chat interface, including the chat messages area and the chat input.

To address the mentioned requirements:

We need to make sure that only the chat messages area is scrollable. This means setting overflow-y: auto; on the container that holds the messages and adjusting its height so that it doesn't overlap with the fixed app bar and chat input.
The chat input should be fixed at the bottom. This can be achieved with position: fixed; and setting it to the bottom of the page.
For better clarity and to avoid potential structural complexities, I'll approach this step by step:

Adjust the chat messages area to be scrollable.
Fix the chat input to the bottom.
Let's start with the chat messages area.

Finished working
Show work
I've adjusted the chat messages area to account for the fixed AppBar and chat input.

Next, we'll fix the chat input to the bottom.

To do this, we need to:

Set the chat input's position as fixed and anchor it to the bottom.
Ensure the chat input has a full width.
Let's make these changes.

Finished working
Show work
I've anchored the chat input to the bottom of the page and ensured it spans the full width.

Now, let's address the labels for the top right 3 components:

Lob label
Collection label for the select component
Upload label for the upload icon
Let's add these labels to the components.

Finished working
Show work
I've added the labels for the top right components in the ChatInterface.tsx:

A "Lob" label before the dropdown icon.
A "Collection" label before the select component.
An "Upload" label before the upload icon.
Now, let's review the contents of Message.tsx to check if any adjustments are necessary for this component.

Finished working
Show work
The Message.tsx component seems to define the structure and behavior of individual chat messages. At this point, it appears that the component's structure does not need changes based on the requirements you've provided.

To summarize the changes made:

AppBar.tsx - Made the app bar fixed at the top.
Sidebar.tsx - Added a scrollbar for when the list grows beyond the screen height.
ChatInterface.tsx -
Adjusted the chat area to be scrollable and account for the fixed AppBar and chat input.
Made the chat input fixed at the bottom.
Added labels for the top right components.
For the last requirement of ensuring the changes are responsive across different screen sizes and browsers, this would typically involve a more comprehensive review process, potentially using browser developer tools and different device emulators. However, the changes made utilize tailwind and Material-UI, which are designed to be responsive out of the box. Further tweaks can be made using tailwind's responsive utilities if necessary.

after making changes to sidebar , now sidebar is not visible and also the last message in the chatinterfae is hidden behind the chat input
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let's address the issues you mentioned.

For the Sidebar:

The issue with the sidebar not being visible might be due to the max-height property I added. We can adjust it to ensure that the sidebar appears correctly.
For the ChatInterface:

The chat messages area might be overlapping with the chat input. We can adjust the padding or margin at the bottom of the chat messages area to ensure that the last message isn't hidden behind the chat input.
Let's start by adjusting the Sidebar.tsx to fix the visibility issue. I'll revert the change I made regarding the max-height and add a height of 100vh minus the AppBar height to ensure it spans the viewport height correctly.

I apologize for the oversight.

Let's address these issues:

For the ChatInterface: We'll ensure that there's ample space at the bottom of the chat area to account for the fixed chat input. If the pb-32 class was not applied correctly, I'll ensure to manually add it to the chat messages area.

making appbar fixed is hiding sidebar
ChatGPT
I see. Making the AppBar fixed causes it to be taken out of the document flow, which could overlap with the Sidebar if no adjustments are made.

To resolve this, we need to adjust the layout to account for the fixed AppBar. Specifically, we should apply a top padding or margin to the main content container (which includes the Sidebar and ChatInterface) equal to the height of the AppBar. This will push the content below the fixed AppBar, ensuring that the Sidebar and the chat area are both fully visible.

Let's make these changes. Do you have a main container or layout file that wraps both the AppBar and the rest of the content? If not, we might need to apply the adjustment directly to the Sidebar.

Thank you for sharing the App.tsx file. Here's what I observed:

The App component renders the AppBar at the top, followed by a container that includes the Sidebar and the ChatInterface.

To ensure the Sidebar and ChatInterface do not overlap with the fixed AppBar, we need to add a top padding or margin to the container that wraps these components.

Let's make the necessary modifications to App.tsx to add a top padding equal to the height of the AppBar (typically 64px).

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Let's take a different approach. Instead of adding padding to the main container, we'll add a top margin to the Sidebar to push it below the AppBar. This approach should work as the AppBar has a typical height of 64px.

I'll add a top margin of 64px (using Tailwind's mt-16 class) to the Sidebar component. Let's make this adjustment and provide you with the updated file.

i made appbar as sticky but now the rest of the content sidebar and chatinterface a scrolling in and out of the sticky ap ba
ChatGPT
When you make the AppBar sticky, it will stay in place as you scroll, but it won't remove itself from the normal document flow. This means that other elements can scroll beneath it.

To prevent the Sidebar and ChatInterface from scrolling under the sticky AppBar, we need to apply a top padding or margin equal to the height of the AppBar. This ensures that when you scroll, the content starts just below the AppBar.

I'll adjust the App.tsx file to add a top padding to the container that wraps both the Sidebar and ChatInterface, ensuring that they don't scroll under the sticky AppBar.

Let's make this adjustment.

no thats awful, give me a solution with fixed app bar
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Let's revert to the fixed AppBar approach and ensure the content beneath it is displayed correctly.

When using a fixed AppBar, the content will naturally flow underneath it since a fixed element doesn't take up space in the document flow. To address this, we'll provide a top margin or padding to the main content container, which holds both the Sidebar and ChatInterface.

Given this, we'll make the following adjustments:

Set the AppBar to a fixed position.
Add a top margin to the main container in App.tsx equal to the height of the AppBar to prevent the Sidebar and ChatInterface from hiding beneath the AppBar.
Let's proceed with these adjustments.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience; it seems we're experiencing some technical issues with the code execution.

However, I'll provide you with a summarized approach to implement the changes, and you can apply them in your development environment:

Add Start Adornment to Chat Input:
tsx
Copy code
<Input
  startAdornment={
    <InputAdornment position="start">
      <AutofixHighIcon className="cursor-pointer" onClick={toggleContextMenu} />
    </InputAdornment>
  }
  // ... other props
/>
State & Event Handler:
At the beginning of your ChatInterface component:
tsx
Copy code
const [contextMenuOpen, setContextMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const toggleContextMenu = () => setContextMenuOpen(!contextMenuOpen);
Context Menu:
Above the chat input, add:
tsx
Copy code
{contextMenuOpen && (
  <div className="absolute bottom-[calc(100%+10px)] left-0 bg-white border p-4 rounded-md">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." className="border p-2 rounded-md w-full mb-2" />
    <div>Prompt 1</div>
    <div>Prompt 2</div>
    <div>Prompt 3</div>
  </div>
)}
Make sure to import the necessary components and hooks (useState, InputAdornment, AutofixHighIcon, etc.) at the top of your file.

You can integrate these code snippets into your ChatInterface.tsx. Once you've applied these changes, test the functionality to see if it works as expected. If you face any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.

The context menu should come right above the highlight icon
ChatGPT
Understood. To ensure the context menu appears right above the AutofixHigh icon, you can utilize relative and absolute positioning. Here's how you can achieve this:

Wrap the AutofixHigh icon in a div with relative positioning: This div will act as the reference point for the absolute positioning of the context menu.
tsx
Copy code
<div className="relative">
    <AutofixHighIcon className="cursor-pointer" onClick={toggleContextMenu} />
    {contextMenuOpen && (
        <div className="absolute bottom-full left-0 bg-white border p-4 rounded-md">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." className="border p-2 rounded-md w-full mb-2" />
            <div>Prompt 1</div>
            <div>Prompt 2</div>
            <div>Prompt 3</div>
        </div>
    )}
</div>
Context Menu Styling: The bottom-full class ensures that the top edge of the context menu aligns with the bottom edge of the icon. The left-0 class makes sure the context menu's left edge aligns with the icon's left edge.
Make sure to integrate this modified structure into the start adornment of the chat input in ChatInterface.tsx.

After applying these changes, the context menu should appear right above the AutofixHigh icon when clicked. Test the functionality to ensure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.

This is not working, it needs to be a menu from mui and the menu should open on top of the icon. And the menu should have search field. Make it compatible with dark mode
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Let's proceed step by step to implement this using Material-UI's Menu component:

Import the Necessary Components:
Ensure you have the following imports at the top of your ChatInterface.tsx:
tsx
Copy code
import { Menu, MenuItem, InputBase, InputAdornment, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import SearchIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Search';
State & Event Handler:
If you haven't already, add the following state and event handlers:
tsx
Copy code
const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = React.useState(null);
const handleClick = (event) => setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);
const handleClose = () => setAnchorEl(null);
Integrate the Menu Component:
Modify the start adornment as follows:
tsx
Copy code
<Input
  startAdornment={
    <InputAdornment position="start">
      <div className="relative">
        <IconButton onClick={handleClick}>
          <AutofixHighIcon />
        </IconButton>
        <Menu
          anchorEl={anchorEl}
          keepMounted
          open={Boolean(anchorEl)}
          onClose={handleClose}
          anchorOrigin={{
            vertical: 'top',
            horizontal: 'center',
          }}
          transformOrigin={{
            vertical: 'bottom',
            horizontal: 'center',
          }}
          PaperProps={{
            style: {
              backgroundColor: theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#fff',
            },
          }}
        >
          <MenuItem>
            <InputBase
              placeholder="Searchâ€¦"
              inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'search' }}
              startAdornment={
                <InputAdornment position="start">
                  <SearchIcon />
                </InputAdornment>
              }
              style={{
                color: theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#333',
              }}
            />
          </MenuItem>
          <MenuItem>Prompt 1</MenuItem>
          <MenuItem>Prompt 2</MenuItem>
          <MenuItem>Prompt 3</MenuItem>
        </Menu>
      </div>
    </InputAdornment>
  }
  // ... other props
/>
Dark Mode Compatibility:
To make it compatible with dark mode, you should have a theme context in place. I used theme.palette.type to check whether the theme is dark or light. Adjust the color accordingly based on your theme configurations.
By following these steps, when you click on the AutofixHigh icon, a Menu from MUI should open on top of the icon with a search field followed by three prompts. The menu will be styled based on the current theme (dark/light).

Please integrate this solution into your ChatInterface.tsx and test it in your environment. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know.

Now add the search functionality to find through the list in the menu . Modify the code to get the prompts list to be displayed as part of menu and display only top 3 ,and when searching show the matching one from the list and add it to the text input once it's selected.
ChatGPT
Alright, let's break down the requirements:

Add search functionality to the search field in the menu.
Initially, display the top 3 prompts from a list.
When searching, display prompts that match the search term.
On selecting a prompt from the list, add it to the chat input field.
Here's a step-by-step solution:

State Management:

Introduce a state for the search term, the filtered list of prompts, and the selected prompt.
Search Functionality:

Filter the list of prompts based on the search term.
Update the filtered list state.
Selection:

On selecting a prompt from the list, update the chat input value with the selected prompt.
Let's integrate these steps into the code.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implement the search functionality:

Step 1: Define the State
tsx
Copy code
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
const [filteredPrompts, setFilteredPrompts] = React.useState([]);
const [selectedPrompt, setSelectedPrompt] = React.useState('');
const prompts = ["Prompt 1", "Prompt 2", "Prompt 3", "..."];  // Add all your prompts here
Step 2: Event Handlers
tsx
Copy code
const handleSearchChange = (e) => {
  const term = e.target.value;
  setSearchTerm(term);
  
  // Filtering prompts based on search term
  const results = prompts.filter(prompt => 
    prompt.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())
  );
  
  setFilteredPrompts(results.slice(0, 3));  // Displaying top 3 results
};

const handlePromptSelect = (prompt) => {
  setSelectedPrompt(prompt);
  setSearchTerm('');  // Clearing the search term
  handleClose();  // Closing the menu
};
Step 3: Modify the Menu Component
Modify the Menu component to integrate the search functionality:

tsx
Copy code
<Menu
  // ... existing props
>
  <MenuItem>
    <InputBase
      placeholder="Searchâ€¦"
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={handleSearchChange}
      inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'search' }}
      startAdornment={
        <InputAdornment position="start">
          <SearchIcon />
        </InputAdornment>
      }
      style={{
        color: theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#333',
      }}
    />
  </MenuItem>
  {filteredPrompts.map(prompt => (
    <MenuItem key={prompt} onClick={() => handlePromptSelect(prompt)}>
      {prompt}
    </MenuItem>
  ))}
</Menu>
Step 4: Update the Chat Input
When a prompt is selected, it should be added to the chat input:

tsx
Copy code
<Input
  value={selectedPrompt}
  // ... other props
/>
Make sure to merge these snippets with your existing code in ChatInterface.tsx. This will implement a search functionality to filter through the list of prompts. Initially, the top 3 prompts will be displayed. When a search term is entered, the list will be updated to show matching prompts. On selecting a prompt, it will be added to the chat input.

After integrating the above code, test the functionality to ensure it meets your requirements. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know.

Get the prompts list from fast API python 
ChatGPT
Alright, let's integrate fetching prompts from a FastAPI backend into the React frontend.

Here are the steps we'll follow:

Set up an endpoint in FastAPI to serve the list of prompts.
Use the fetch API in the React frontend to request this list.
Step 1: FastAPI Backend
If you haven't set up a FastAPI application yet, here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

prompts = ["Prompt 1", "Prompt 2", "Prompt 3", "Prompt 4", "Prompt 5"]

@app.get("/prompts")
def get_prompts():
    return {"prompts": prompts}
To run this, you would typically use:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn filename:app --reload
This will start the FastAPI server, and the prompts will be accessible at: http://localhost:8000/prompts

Step 2: React Frontend Fetch
In your ChatInterface.tsx:

Create a state to hold the list of prompts.
Use the useEffect hook to fetch the prompts when the component mounts.
Here's the code:

tsx
Copy code
const [allPrompts, setAllPrompts] = React.useState([]);

React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:8000/prompts")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setAllPrompts(data.prompts))
        .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching prompts:", error));
}, []);
Now, whenever you need to filter prompts or display them, you'll use the allPrompts state.

Make sure you handle CORS when connecting your frontend to the FastAPI backend. In FastAPI, you can use the CORS middleware to achieve this:

python
Copy code
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
Please adjust the allow_origins to be more specific in a production environment.

After you integrate these changes, the React frontend should fetch the list of prompts from the FastAPI backend. Make sure both the frontend and the backend are running, and test to see if it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further help, please let me know.

now on click of the prompt from the menu if the prompt contains variables of this form {var1} in the prompt statement then open a modal window to fill the variable value. modal should have title and subtitle as Enter Values
Add values to your prompt variables. and it should have text field for each variable with label as variable name for the text field and Done/cancel buttons. once done is clicked then show the prompt with actual values in the chat input and disable editing.Prompt list that comes from fast api has structure like [{'pomptid":1,"promptname":"banker","prompt":"Act as banker for {X}"}]
ChatGPT
To achieve this functionality, let's break down the tasks:

Parse the selected prompt to detect variables in the form {var1}.
If variables are detected, open a modal with input fields for each variable.
Collect values for these variables and replace them in the prompt.
Display the final prompt in the chat input and disable editing.
Here's a step-by-step guide to implement this:

Step 1: Parse the Selected Prompt
On selecting a prompt from the list, parse the prompt string to extract variables.

Step 2: Open Modal with Input Fields
If variables are found, open a modal window with input fields for each variable. Each input will be labeled with the variable name.

Step 3: Collect and Replace Variable Values
On clicking the "Done" button in the modal, replace the variables in the prompt with the entered values.

Step 4: Display the Final Prompt
Show the final prompt in the chat input and disable editing.

Let's start by implementing this logic in the ChatInterface.tsx. I'll provide a detailed outline with code snippets for each step.

Let's proceed step by step:

Step 1: Handling Prompt Selection & Parsing
Upon selecting a prompt, extract variables using a regular expression:

tsx
Copy code
const handlePromptSelect = (prompt) => {
    const variablePattern = /\{([^\}]+)\}/g;
    const variables = [...prompt.matchAll(variablePattern)].map(match => match[1]);

    if (variables.length) {
        // Save the variables and open the modal
        setVariablesToFill(variables);
        setPromptTemplate(prompt);
        setOpenModal(true);
    } else {
        // No variables, just set the prompt
        setSelectedPrompt(prompt);
    }
};
Step 2: Modal with Input Fields
Use Material-UI's Dialog component to create a modal:

tsx
Copy code
import { Dialog, DialogActions, DialogContent, DialogTitle, TextField, Button } from '@material-ui/core';

const [openModal, setOpenModal] = useState(false);
const [variablesToFill, setVariablesToFill] = useState([]);
const [filledValues, setFilledValues] = useState({});
const [promptTemplate, setPromptTemplate] = useState('');

// Inside the component's return statement:

<Dialog open={openModal} onClose={() => setOpenModal(false)}>
    <DialogTitle>Enter Values</DialogTitle>
    <DialogContent>
        <p>Add values to your prompt variables.</p>
        {variablesToFill.map(variable => (
            <TextField
                key={variable}
                label={variable}
                variant="outlined"
                fullWidth
                margin="normal"
                onChange={e => setFilledValues(prev => ({ ...prev, [variable]: e.target.value }))}
            />
        ))}
    </DialogContent>
    <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={() => setOpenModal(false)}>Cancel</Button>
        <Button onClick={handleDone}>Done</Button>
    </DialogActions>
</Dialog>
Step 3: Handle 'Done' Click
On "Done" click, replace the variables in the prompt with the entered values:

tsx
Copy code
const handleDone = () => {
    let finalPrompt = promptTemplate;
    for (let variable in filledValues) {
        finalPrompt = finalPrompt.replace(`{${variable}}`, filledValues[variable]);
    }
    setSelectedPrompt(finalPrompt);
    setOpenModal(false);
};
Step 4: Display Final Prompt in Chat Input
Simply bind the selectedPrompt state to the chat input:

tsx
Copy code
<Input value={selectedPrompt} disabled={true} ... />
These steps should implement the required functionality. Please integrate the provided code snippets into your ChatInterface.tsx. After integration, ensure you have the necessary imports from Material-UI and other required libraries.

Test the functionality to check if it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, let me know.

change the fast api to address the prompt list structure as array f objects
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's update the FastAPI code to serve the prompts as an array of objects, as you've mentioned: [{ "promptid": 1, "promptname": "banker", "prompt": "Act as banker for {X}" }, ...].

Here's the modified FastAPI code:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI
from typing import List, Dict

app = FastAPI()

prompts = [
    {"promptid": 1, "promptname": "banker", "prompt": "Act as banker for {X}"},
    # Add other prompts as needed
]

@app.get("/prompts", response_model=List[Dict[str, str]])
def get_prompts():
    return prompts
This will serve the list of prompts in the desired structure. Ensure that you've installed FastAPI and Uvicorn to run the API:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn
To run the API:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn filename:app --reload
Replace filename with the name of the Python file containing the FastAPI app. Once the server is running, the prompts will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/prompts.

Make sure to include the CORS middleware in FastAPI if your frontend is running on a different port or domain.

After updating your FastAPI code, your React frontend should be able to fetch the prompts as objects from the backend. Test the integration, and if you face any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.

is there a change required in the chatInterface as per the prompt list changges
ChatGPT
Yes, given the change in the structure of the prompt list, adjustments will be needed in ChatInterface.tsx.

Here are the steps and code adjustments:

1. Update the State for Storing Prompts
Previously, if you were storing prompts as a simple array of strings, you'll now need to store them as an array of objects. You can use:

tsx
Copy code
const [allPrompts, setAllPrompts] = React.useState([]);
2. Update the Fetching Logic
When fetching the prompts from the backend, you might have previously set the state directly with the fetched data. With the new structure, you'll be storing the entire object:

tsx
Copy code
React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:8000/prompts")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setAllPrompts(data))
        .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching prompts:", error));
}, []);
3. Adjust Prompt Selection Logic
When a prompt is selected from the menu, you'll now be working with an object instead of a simple string. Adjust your selection logic to account for this. For instance:

tsx
Copy code
const handlePromptSelect = (promptObj) => {
    const promptText = promptObj.prompt;
    // ... rest of the logic remains similar
};
4. Adjust Display Logic in Menu
When displaying the prompts in the menu, you'll need to adjust how you render each item since you're working with objects. For example:

tsx
Copy code
{allPrompts.map(promptObj => (
    <MenuItem key={promptObj.promptid} onClick={() => handlePromptSelect(promptObj)}>
      {promptObj.promptname}
    </MenuItem>
))}
With these adjustments, your ChatInterface.tsx should be compatible with the new structure of the prompt list. After making these changes, test the application to ensure that the prompts are fetched, displayed, and processed correctly. If you face any issues or need further guidance, please let me know.
